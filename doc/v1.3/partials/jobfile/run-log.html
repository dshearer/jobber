  <h3>Keeping a Log of Job Runs</h3>

  <p>
    <code>jobber log</code> command prints info about 100 last runs.
    This info &mdash; <dfn>run log</dfn> &mdash; is kept in memory by
    default, but you can change this in the <code>prefs</code>
    section of the jobfile.
  </p>

  <p>`jobber` allows to change limits for *run log* in memory, or chose to write
    it to disk to avoid losing it when the Jobber service stops or restarts.</p>

  <p>Here is an example of configuring the run log in memory:</p>
  <pre>[prefs]
runLog:
    type: memory
    maxLen: 500</pre>

  <p>With this, Jobber will keep log entries for no more than the 500 most
    recent runs of any of the user&rsquo;s jobs.</p>

  <p>Here is an example of keeping the run log on disk:</p>
  <pre>[prefs]
runLog:
    type: file
    path: /var/log/jobber-runs
    maxFileLen: 100m
    maxHistories: 2</pre>

  <p>With this, Jobber will write run log entries to /var/log/jobber-runs.
    /var/log/jobber-runs will grow to no more than 100 MB, and Jobber will
    rotate it when it gets too big. Jobber will keep up to two of these
    rotated &ldquo;history&rdquo; files (named &ldquo;jobber-runs.1&rdquo; and
    &ldquo;jobber-runs.2&rdquo;). When it is necessary to delete a history file,
    the oldest one will get the axe.</p>
