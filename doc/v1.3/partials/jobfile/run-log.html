  <h3>Keeping a Log of Job Runs</h3>

  <p>
    The <code>jobber log</code> command prints the <dfn>run log</dfn> &mdash;
    i.e, a log containing info about previous runs.  By default, the run log
    contains the 100 recent runs and is kept in memory, which means that it will
    be lost when the Jobber server stops or restarts.
  </p>

  <p>`jobber` allows to change limits for *run log* in memory, or chose to write
    it to disk to avoid losing it when the Jobber service stops or restarts.</p>

  <p>Here is an example of configuring the run log in memory:</p>
  <pre>[prefs]
runLog:
    type: memory
    maxLen: 500</pre>

  <p>With this, Jobber will keep log entries for no more than the 500 most
    recent runs of any of the user&rsquo;s jobs.</p>

  <p>Here is an example of keeping the run log on disk:</p>
  <pre>[prefs]
runLog:
    type: file
    path: /var/log/jobber-runs
    maxFileLen: 100m
    maxHistories: 2</pre>

  <p>With this, Jobber will write run log entries to /var/log/jobber-runs.
    /var/log/jobber-runs will grow to no more than 100 MB, and Jobber will
    rotate it when it gets too big. Jobber will keep up to two of these
    rotated &ldquo;history&rdquo; files (named &ldquo;jobber-runs.1&rdquo; and
    &ldquo;jobber-runs.2&rdquo;). When it is necessary to delete a history file,
    the oldest one will get the axe.</p>
